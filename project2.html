        <h1>Who are We!!!</h1>
        <p>Our Team are working on improving soft skills of many fellow members. We know, how soft skills plays a crucial role in our professional life. Many people are lacking in their soft skills. These skills arenâ€™t like Technical things to learn and apply somewhere. Everything in soft skill is to be adopted. For getting adopted to a new behaviour, we need to cross our boundaries in communicating with unknown people, speaking in front of a crowd, responding/ answering to the questions spontaneously,......, etc.</p>
